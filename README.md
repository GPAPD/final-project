Restaurant Food Ordering Application

This project is a React Native mobile application developed as part of our 2nd-year university final group project. The app allows users to order food from a restaurant, track the status of their orders, and make payments. The application is designed to provide a seamless user experience with real-time updates for both customers and kitchen staff.
Features

    Browse Menu: Users can view the restaurantâ€™s menu and select items for their orders.
    Real-Time Order Tracking: Customers can track the status of their food orders in real-time, from preparation to delivery.
    Firebase Integration: We utilize Firebase as the backend database to manage real-time data, ensuring live updates for both users and kitchen staff.

Technologies Used

    Firebase: For real-time database management and user authentication.
    JavaScript: The primary language used for development.
